## Contribution guide

All tasks MUST be first placed into JIRA - if you don't have access there contact NommoPL.

## Main rules
* No committing into master
* No single committing - every change needs it's own branch

## Naming rules
Branch should be named in following pattern:

``JIRA-NR_Short_Desc``

Pull request should be named:

``[JIRA-NR] Human readable name``

Every pull request needs to pass check by Travis!

Later on all commits of branch are being squashed and merged into master.
